# geoloc
This is a simple script to obtain the geolocation of several IPs using the API of the ipinfo.io website since it is the one that allows the most requests per month for free.

The format of the CSV input must be IP,count.

All this can be modified to your liking, either the API that best suits you or the type of csv that suits you.



Example of csv output:
Address,Country,Events
83.132.147.71,Portugal,7
105.71.144.157,Morocco,2
31.221.136.199,Spain,6
213.99.100.140,Spain,1
86.111.123.229,Poland,2
172.16.1.21,Internal,2
137.101.1.55,Spain,4
188.26.197.79,Spain,2
176.103.168.75,Poland,2
83.132.147.71,Portugal,2
139.47.72.113,Spain,6





This script can be used and modified as you wish.
